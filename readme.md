Q3 - rujia (p12554)
========================

There are n people (excluding myself) in my 30th birthday party. They sing the traditional “happy
birthday” song:

> *Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to Rujia! Happy birthday to you!!!*

Since I love music, I want to hear something more interesting, not that everyone sings together. Ah yes, I want one person to sing one word!

For example, there are three people: Mom, Dad, Girlfriend, I’d like them to sing like this:

```
Mom: Happy
Dad: birthday
Girlfriend: to
Mom: you
Dad: Happy
Girlfriend: birthday
Mom: to
Dad: you
Girlfriend: Happy
Mom: birthday
Dad: to
Girlfriend: Rujia
Mom: Happy
Dad: birthday
Girlfriend: to
Mom: you
```

Very nice, right? What if there are more than 16 people? That’s easy: repeat the song until
everyone has sung at least once :)

Please, don’t stop in the middle of the song.

## Input

The input contains a single line of strings. Each of the n strings contains a capitalized name (i.e. one upper-case letter followed by zero or more lowercase
letters). Each name contains at most 100 characters and do not have whitespace characters inside.
Name and gender fields are required.

## Output

Output the Happy Birthday song as demonstrated above and at the end include the song Good Fellow using the correct pronoun determined by the selected Gender. See sample screen shots below.

Note: Most of the HTML, CSS and JS code to create dynamic textboxes to get guests name, **the focus is on generating the songs**

**New things to learn:** The use of form and the use w3.css framework (https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) an alternative to bootstrap
